DVWA Report & Learning Journey
This repository documents my exploration of vulnerabilities within the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA).

What is DVWA?

DVWA is a deliberately insecure web application designed for educational purposes. It allows security enthusiasts to safely learn about web application vulnerabilities and how to identify and exploit them in a controlled environment.

What's in this Repository?

This repository contains my report on the vulnerabilities discovered within DVWA.

The report may include (modify based on your approach):

Methodology: A description of the tools and techniques used to identify vulnerabilities within DVWA (e.g., manual testing, security scanners).
Identified Vulnerabilities: A detailed explanation of each vulnerability found, including:
Description of the vulnerability
Potential impact of the vulnerability
Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (optional, for educational purposes only)
Mitigation strategies to address the vulnerability
Learning Outcomes: Reflection on the key takeaways from this exercise.
Additional Resources (Optional): Links to helpful resources on web application security and vulnerability testing.
Disclaimer:

The information in this repository is for educational purposes only. Exploiting vulnerabilities in real-world applications is illegal and unethical.

Contribution

Feel free to reach out and contribute to this project by sharing your experience with DVWA or suggesting improvements to the report.

Future Work

This exploration of DVWA serves as a stepping stone for further learning in web application security.  Future endeavors may include:

Contributing to open-source security projects
Building a secure web application with best practices
Analyzing real-world web application vulnerabilities (following responsible disclosure practices)
I am actively seeking opportunities to expand my cybersecurity knowledge and skills.
